# monome-mods
alternate firmwares for monome eurorack modules and other monome mods

for more info including  toolchain set up and how to flash firmware see http://monome.org/docs/modular

you'll need the monome skeleton library, get it here: https://github.com/tehn/mod
put it in the same folder where your monome-mods folder is (so rootfolder\mod and rootfolder\monome-mods)

i had to include the atmel framework here again even though it's already included in tehn/mod
- couldn't figure out how to modify makefile to make it work, if somebody does please let me know!

for questions feel free to open issues or email me directly, or find me on http://llllllll.co/
