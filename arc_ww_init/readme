0. you will need to have the toolchain set up first. see http://monome.org/docs/modular:toolchain
  
1. modify config.mk - replace arc_ww_init with the name of your firmware in this line: THIS = arc_ww_init  
  
2. if you're using flash.command / flash.sh update the name of the hex file  
  
3. depending on where you place the template you might need to modify Makefile and config.mk 
to point to correct locations of the monome skeleton and the atmel xdk-asf-3.17.0 frameworks

- if you clone/fork my repo you will also need to clone/fork https://github.com/tehn/mod and put both 
  in the same folder and then you should be good to go

- you could clone/fork tehn/mod repo and then just copy arc_ww_init folder there if you prefer, 
  if you do just copy Makefile and config.mk from whitewhale and edit config.mk 
  (replace "whitewhale" with whatever you call your firmware)
